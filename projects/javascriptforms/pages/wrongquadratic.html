  <h1>Methods to solve quadratic equations.</h1>
  <h2>Quadratic Formula</h2>
  <h3>The Quadratic formula can solve any quadratic equation.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First, find the a, b, and c value. They are in the form of
    ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c.</li>
    <li>Then, square the b term.</li>
    <li>Multiply the a term by the c term and then the product by 4.</li>
    <li>Subtract your result from part 3 from your result in part 2.</li>
    <li>Take the square root of you previous answer.</li>
    <li>Add your answer to -b, and then also subtract is form -b. These two
    answers divided by 2 give you your two roots!.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Completing the Square</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Put the X terms on one side and the constants on the other side.</li>
    <li>Take half of the X term (coefficient), and square it.</li>
    <li>Rewrite the part in step 2 as a perfect square.</li>
    <li>Take the square root of both sides.</li>
    <li>Simplify the radical.</li>
    <li>Isolate the X term.</li>
    <li>Combine like terms.</li>
    <li>Solve for whatever makes it zero. These are your two roots.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Graphing</h1>
  <p>You can graph the function in a graphing program such as desmos, and see where the graph intersects the x-axis.</p>

  <h1>Factoring</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Find whatever two numbers that add together to be the coefficient of the x term,
    and mulitply to be the constant.</li>
    <li>Rewrite it as (x+whatever term you found in part 1)*(x+the second term you found in part one.)</li>
  </ol>
