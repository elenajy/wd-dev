    This is a screenshot I took of the first game I played with Rosa. Rosa is the newest brawler that has been added to the game Brawl Stars developed by Supercell.
    Rosa is a broken brawler as she is very OP. She recently got nerfed, but she is still incredibly strong. The game in the above picture occured a couple hours Rosa
    was released as she was a rare brawler that almost everyone got right away.
