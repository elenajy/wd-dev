    <h4>As part of an English EC project, I have put on the internet a personal letter I wrote about procrastination.</h4>
    <br>
    <hr><br>
    <p><b>Dear the Procrastinating Champion,</b></p>
    <p>The irony of the situation is that you procrastinated on writing this letter, even though it should help you
        stop procrastinating. I know that you always feel guilty about procrastinating, and that you tend to stress out
        about all the work you have to do due to your YouTube addiction. It seems to me that you continue to fall down
        the spiral of self-hatred and self-neglect as your feelings bounce back and forth from “Should I work on this
        assignment?” to “Slice n’ Dice!” I understand, you want to stop procrastinating; however, any attempt made to
        stop procrastinating seems to be put off for “tomorrow”.</p>
    <p>Do not fret as you are not alone; according to the American Psychological Association, over eighty-five percent
        of students suffer from procrastination. But why? Why do we continue to procrastinate? Why do we continue to do
        this to ourselves when we know that if we just get the job done, then we might be able to relax without the
        lingering thought in the back of our minds of that one English assign – ‘Have no fear as Mortis is here!’ Oh,
        never mind then. If we want to lead a healthy lifestyle, we need to stop procrastinating as procrastination is
        detrimental to one’s mental health. The ways that each individual can cope with procrastination is different,
        but I know for you, you can leave the procrastination lifestyle away by identifying your procrastination
        issues, using your technology wisely, and dealing with unmotivation.</p>
    <p> According to Brown University, the first step into becoming productive is to acknowledge what is keeping you
        from achieving your goals. We can only solve a problem if we know what is causing it. So what is causing you to
        procrastinate? Brawl Stars, YouTube, Instagram… I know. You are distracted by pleasurable activities, mainly
        technology. But these pleasurable activities are only a Band-Aid to cover your eyes from the aging scar that is
        developing due to your procrastination. These pleasurable activities are Gatorade. They may seem to be
        “beneficial” for the time-being, but in the long run, they will in fact be harmful because you develop will
        develop stress when you realize all the tasks you have to get done. On the other hand, getting your work done,
        similar to water, both satisfies you in the short-term by creating less stress and a sense of
        self-satisfaction, but it also satisfies you in the long run by avoiding conflict detrimental to your mental
        health. This is because a continued cycle of procrastination gets you nowhere – you aren’t able to achieve
        anything, and if you have a time-constraint, your health suffers as a result due to stress. According to,
        Forbes, procrastination has negative effect on your mental health by causing you to do things that you wouldn’t
        necessarily do. For example, making a decision under the time constraint of pressure may result in a different
        result and negative consequence that then decision you would have made if you didn’t procrastinate.</p>
    <p>For everyone, especially in teenagers, technology seems to be a main issue for procrastination. With technology
        being such an integrated part in today’s society, it’s no wonder why it is such a large issue with things being
        put on the back burner. It is impossible to completely get rid of technology, so instead you should focus on
        making it a beneficial aspect in your life (rather than letting it take over your life). Dr. Joseph Ferrari of
        the University of Chicago says that we should “Use technology as a tool, not as a means of delay”. He suggests
        ways that we can put our technology to good use, such as installing apps that time us out of distracting sites
        after ten minutes. These methods remind us to not procrastinate and to get our work done. Technology is not
        always the bad guy, it is the good guy if we know how to correctly use it.</p>
    <p> I understand that at times you feel unmotivated to do complete your tasks. Sometimes, you just don’t feel like
        doing the work, and others times, the work does not interest you. According to Oregon State University, and
        lack of motivation is often the problem causing procrastination. However, the key to getting rid of a lack of
        motivation can be as simple as just starting the task. It is often venturing into the first step that acts as
        the trigger for getting a task done. In other situations, it is often a lack of interest that prevents work
        from getting done. In this case, it is best to just get it done. If you do this, then the time that you can
        devote to doing things that you enjoy will be less worrisome, and you can have a more enjoyable time.</p>
    <p>I know what you are thinking: “I have tried to stop procrastinating, and trust me, it is easier said than done.
        Once the urge to push my Mortis to 500 trophies kicks in, there’s no turning back. And in the end, I get things
        done. I mean, I turn in all my homework, I complete assigned tasks, and I get to play Brawl Stars. I mean,
        procrastination has little to no effect on me as I get all my work done.” </p>
    <p>I completely agree with you that stopping procrastination is easier said than done. Quitting a problem such as
        procrastination takes time and small steps. According to psychologists in the European Journal of Social
        Psychology, creating a lasting behavioral pattern takes a while – anywhere from 18 to 254 days. However, if you
        don’t start now on modifying your habits, you will never get around to it. The effort put into stopping
        procrastination will pay off in the end – you will not have to stress out last minute about completing
        assignments. Don’t say that you can do the assignment later; rather, say you can get it done now and off of
        your chest. However, you can just start out of nowhere and say “I’m not procrastinate anymore!” Again, the
        process takes time. However, it order to create accountability on your journey to quitting procrastinating, you
        should set up small goals along the way (e.g., productive for three days in a role), as well as rewards.
        Positive interval reinforcement is key to success. </p>
    <p>However, you are mistaken when you say that procrastination has little to no effect on you. Even though you are
        able to get your work done, I promise you that it comes with unnecessary added stress and emotional baggage.
        How many times have you worked countless hours on a project the day before it was due, tired, depressed, and
        ashamed that you didn’t start sooner? These feelings are detrimental to your mental health, and as
        procrastination is a habit for you, you need to stop procrastination in order to preserve your mental health,
        and to overall, life a healthier lifestyle.</p>

        This article talks about the psychology behind procrastination. It cites David Ballard, who is the head of the
        American Psychological Association’s Center for Organizational Excellence. Ballard says that procrastination
        includes one of four triggers; these are expectancy, value, time or impulsivity. These triggers, or rather, a
        lack of these triggers, is what causes people to procrastinate. It then goes on to highlight specific scenarios
        of procrastination and give advice on how to overcome procrastination.</p>

        The article mainly talks about the endowment effect. In essence, people will place more work on an item that
        they own. The authors cites a study dealing with pizza to show an applicable example of the endowment effect.
        This idea is not just limited to pizza and objects, however. We can translate this psychologic idea into
        procrastination. If you can imagine that you achieved your goal, then you are more likely to achieve it,
        because you “have” it (ownership) and you do not want it to be taken away.</p>

        The author talks about why people procrastinate. People procrastinate due to fear, which is embedded from the
        fear of failure, or looking silly. However, this fear does not stop as time goes on, but rather continues
        piling up, making us feel more and more guilty. This article also offers strategies in order to reverse your
        trend of procrastination and how to get things done.</p>
